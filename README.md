# MaskRCNN_HumanPose_Estimation
Mask R-CNN Implementation for Human Pose Estimation

The methodology used in this project is Mask R-CNN, with Python on Jupyter Notebooks, Keras and TensorFlow along with coco/pycocotools packages.

The primary codebase was obtained from GitHub repositories of public implementation of Mask R-CNNs. Those are provided below for reference: -
